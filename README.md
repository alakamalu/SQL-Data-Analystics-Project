# 🧠 Advanced SQL Analytics Project – Customer & Product Insights

Welcome to the **Advanced SQL Analytics Project**, a real-world end-to-end data analytics solution powered entirely by **SQL**. This project simulates how data analysts work with large datasets to generate actionable insights, build performance KPIs, and deliver clean, ready-to-use reporting views for business stakeholders and dashboard tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

* ✅ Perform **deep customer and product analysis** using raw transactional data
* ✅ Implement **advanced SQL techniques** like CTEs, segmentation logic, and KPI computation
* ✅ Create **modular and reusable SQL scripts** for exploration, transformation, and reporting
* ✅ Build **final reporting views** for use by analysts or dashboard developers
* ✅ Demonstrate a full **analytics pipeline** using SQL from raw data to insight delivery

  * Average order value (AOV)
  * Average monthly spend

### 🔹 Product Report View (`gold.report_products`)

* Product metadata: name, category, subcategory
* Product segmentation by revenue performance: High / Mid / Low
* KPIs:

  * Average order revenue
